        <h2>Covistra Mobile Backend Framework V2</h2>
        <p>After more than two years of building and improving the first version of CMBF, we've learned a lot about
          creating an enterprise platform using Node.JS. We try to provide an easy to learn and evolve platform that
          will ease the life of thousands of enterprise developers. The first version was a good start, providing most
          foundation blocks to quickly deploy a backend for enterprise mobile apps. But it came short in many ways and,
          even with the integration of Seneca as a micro-service framework, it was still very monolithic.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Enterprise Focus</dt>
          <dd>Enterprise development is about long-term maintainability, defensive development, multiple teams and fast deployment</dd>
          <dt>Sane Micro-Services Practices</dt>
          <dd>While micro-services provides architectural flexibility, they can prevent teams from seeing the big picture and create
          critical feature visibility issues. A good enterprise micro-service framework must address discovery, documentation and reusability
          </dd>
          <dt>Modern Cluster Hosting</dt>
          <dd>We target modern CoreOS and Apache Mesos clustering technology.</dd>
          <dt>Real-Time Data Processing</dt>
          <dd>The capacity to analyze data as it moves in the system can greatly reduce system complexity and development costs. We plan on
          integrating first-class realtime data processing and data storage services.
          </dd>
          <dt>Versioning</dt>
          <dd>Good versioning of all service API is key to maintainability. Version management can quickly become a nightmare, it has to be
          built-in from the start</dd>
          <dt>Security</dt>
          <dd>Make sure all services are secure and integrate popular security standards for permissions and data visibility control</dd>
          <dt>Good Tooling</dt>
          <dd>Our goal is to provide a set of tools that will simplify system management. Easy packaging and deployment of services.</dd>
          <dt>IoT and Mobile Support</dt>
          <dd>Enterprises should include mobile and IoT as part of their operating platform.</dd>
